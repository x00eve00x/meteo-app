# Météo-app

This is a simple web application (in French) that allows you to search for the current forecast. The user simply need to enter the name of the city
and its country, then click the button. Informations will then appear on the screen: the exact location, the temperature (value = average
of the temperatures in a day in celcius at that specific location), the humidity and the conditions (description). 

The application is made with react.js, using create-react-app and then I customize it, added files, components, etc.

## To open the application
You need to open the command line and "cd" (if using Windows) to the folder "meteo-app" and then "npm start" it.
It should then open in your browser. :)
